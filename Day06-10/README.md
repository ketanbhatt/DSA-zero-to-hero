* [HackerRank - Trees](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trees)
* [GeeksforGeeks - Binary Trees](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/#BinaryTree)

### Solved:
1. Insertion in a balanced binary tree
2. Height of a binary tree
3. Size of a binary tree
4. Preorder traversal of a binary tree
5. Inorder traversal of a binary tree
6. Postorder traversal of a binary tree
7. Level order traversal of a binary tree
8. Reverse level order traversal of binary tree
9. Level order traversal in spiral form
10. Vertical order traversal of a binary tree
11. Topview of a binary tree
12. Leftview of a binary tree
13. Rightview of a binary tree
14. Bottomview of a binary tree
15. Boundary traversal of a binary tree
16. Level of a node in a binary Tree
17. Find all leaf nodes of a binary tree
18. Find all root to leaf paths of a binary tree
19. Check if all leaves are at same level
20. Find maximum and minimum in a binary tree
21. Diameter of a binary tree
22. Maximum width of a binary tree
23. Determine if a binary tree is height-balanced
24. Convert a binary tree into its mirror tree
25. Determine if two binary trees are Identical
26. Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree


### Todo:

* Find the closest leaf in a binary tree from the given node and the distance
* Find inorder successor for all nodes


PS: Don't solve traversal, view etc questions just recursively, solve them iteratively too if possible.
