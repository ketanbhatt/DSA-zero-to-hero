### Todo:

* [Check whether a given Binary Tree is Complete](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-given-binary-tree-is-complete-tree-or-not/)
* [Check if a given Binary Tree is SumTree](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-given-binary-tree-is-sumtree/)

* Find the closest leaf in a binary tree from the given node and the distance
* Find inorder successor for all nodes
* [Construct a binary tree from two traversal sequences](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/if-you-are-given-two-traversal-sequences-can-you-construct-the-binary-tree/)

PS: Don't solve traversal, view etc questions just recursively, solve them iteratively too if possible.
