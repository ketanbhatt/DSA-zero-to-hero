## Day 11 Binary Search Trees: 



### To Do:

1. Search and Insert in BST
2. Deletion from BST
3. Minimum value in a Binary Search Tree
4. [Inorder predecessor and successor for a given key in BST](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-predecessor-successor-given-key-bst/)
5. Check if a binary tree is BST or not
6. Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree.
7. Find k-th smallest/largest element in BST (Order Statistics in BST)
8. Floor and Ceil from a BST
9. Construct BST from given preorder traversal


### Further Ahead:
* Sorted Array to Balanced BST
* Sorted Linked List to Balanced BST
* In-place conversion of Sorted DLL to Balanced BST
