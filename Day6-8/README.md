* [HackerRank - Trees](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trees)
* [GeeksforGeeks - Binary Trees](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/#BinaryTree)

### Solved:
1. Insertion in a balanced binary tree
2. Height of a binary tree
3. Size of a binary tree
4. Preorder traversal of a binary tree
5. Inorder traversal of a binary tree
6. Postorder traversal of a binary tree
7. Level order traversal of a binary tree
8. Level order traversal in spiral form
9. Vertical order traversal of a binary tree
10. Topview of a binary tree
11. Leftview of a binary tree
12. Rightview of a binary tree

### Todo:

* Bottomview of a binary tree
* Boundary traversal of a binary tree
* Level of a node in a binary Tree
* All leaf nodes of a binary tree
* All root to leaf paths of a binary tree
* Check if all leaves are at same level
* Find maximum and minimum in a binary tree
* Diameter of a binary tree
* Maximum width of a binary tree
* Find the closest leaf in a binary tree from the given node and the distance

* Determine if a binary tree is height-balanced
* Find inorder successor for all nodes
* Convert a binary tree into its mirror tree
* Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree
* Determine if two binary trees are Identical

### Further in Series:
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree (Self Balancing Tree)
