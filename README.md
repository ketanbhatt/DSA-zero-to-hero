### Index
1. [Day 1 - Fibonacci](Day1/)
2. [Day 2 - Sorting](Day2/)
3. Day 3 - Read about graphs, trees and heaps enough to implement Heap Sort


### Coming up next
1. Linked Lists
2. More on graphs and trees, BST

### TO DO
1. Make sort functions take comparators so they can sort classes too.
2. Implement the English dictionary using TRIE data structure. Like how it happens in T9 keyboards.
3. Given a 300 mb CSV file with 7 fields as follows : ID, name, age, gender, description. You have to show some data on the browser. Given an id I should get the entire details immediately. Given a name I should also get the multiple rows associated with it.
4. Taking the 300 mb file as "seed" generate another random file which is 17 times the size of your RAM + allocated virtual/swap memory. In this case your index file will grow beyond the RAM size. Suggest an appropriate solution and implement. Defend your design decisions ruling out all possible data structures (and file structures). Any weak design decision argument will not be accepted. Use space and time complexity algebra wherever necessary
